# DEBUGGING PROJECT
1. 0-main.c, main.h - create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
2. 1-main.c - Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
3. 2-largest_number.c, main.h - This program prints the largest of three integers.Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
4. 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.Fix the print_remaining_d   ays() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

5. Line count will not be checked for this task.
   You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or grea   ter than 31).
   You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. Februar   y 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
